    Date: Keep the original email timestamp.

    Subject: Ensure the subject line is included.

2. Structure the Email for Readability

    Format the content using clear section headers, bullet points, and concise paragraphs.

    Remove any unnecessary formatting or HTML tags 

    Remove emojis and special characters that do not add value to the content.

3. Remove Non-Content Elements

    Delete interaction links (e.g., "Subscribe," "Sign up," "Click here").

    Remove marketing phrases (e.g., "Act now! Limited time offer!").

    Discard full URLs unless they are essential to understanding the content. Instead, keep only the source name (e.g., Source: Tech Digest).

4. Ensure Consistency & Clarity

    Retain only factual, useful content in a neutral tone.

    Use simple, structured formatting to enhance LLM comprehension
